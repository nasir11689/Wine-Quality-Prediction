# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This Algorithm can be used in wine industry to predict the quality of wine. And then the prices can be set accordingly.
In the 'customer segment' column of the the dataset, there are values 1, 2, 3.(first quality, second quality, third quality wine).
The data has been labelled based on the percentage of chemicals in the wine.
We have used  Random Forest Classifier in this project and trained it with our dataset.
The accuracy percentage obtained is 93.
We have also tried using knn algorithm but the accuracy obtained is 90 percentage.
